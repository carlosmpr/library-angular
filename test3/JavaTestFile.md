  # JavaTestFile.java
  ## Code Explanation

### Description:
The code snippet provided is a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

### Code:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

### Explanation:
- The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as input.
- If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns 1 as the factorial of 0 is 1.
- If `n` is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`.
- This recursive process continues until `n` reaches 0, at which point the function starts returning the accumulated product of all numbers from `n` down to 1.

### Usage:
To use the `factorial` function, you can call it with an integer argument representing the number for which you want to calculate the factorial.

#### Example:
```python
result = factorial(5)
print(result)  # Output: 120
```

### External Libraries or Dependencies:
No external libraries or dependencies are required for this code snippet as it only uses core Python functionality for recursion and basic arithmetic operations.
